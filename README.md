## Overview

DRfold2 is a deep learning method for RNA structure prediction. At its core, DRfold2 utilizes the RNA Composite Language Model (RCLM), which provides enhanced full likelihood approximation capabilities to effectively capture co-evolutionary signals from unsupervised sequence data.

### Key Features

- Advanced RNA Composite Language Model (RCLM)
- End-to-end structure and geometry prediction
- Optimized post-processing protocol
- Superior performance in both 3D structure prediction and 2D base pair modeling

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Minimal Requirements
- Python (tested on 3.10.4, 3.11.4, and 3.11.7)
- PyTorch (tested on 1.11, 2.01, and 2.21)
- NumPy
- SciPy

#### Optional Dependencies
- OpenMM (required for structure refinement) - [Installation Guide](https://openmm.org/)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone and navigate to the DRfold2 directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leeyang/DRfold2
   cd DRfold2
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```
   This will download model weights ~1.3GB and install Arena.

## Usage

### Basic Structure Prediction

For single model prediction:
```bash
python DRfold_infer.py [input fasta file] [output_dir]
```

For multiple model prediction (up to 5 models):
```bash
python DRfold_infer.py [input fasta file] [output_dir] 1
```

### Parameters

- `[input fasta file]`: Target sequence in FASTA format
- `[output_dir]`: Directory for saving intermediate and final results
- Final predictions will be saved as `[output dir]/relax/model_*.pdb`

### Structure Refinement (Optional)

To further refine a predicted structure:
```bash
python script/refine.py [input pdb] [output pdb]
```

## Example Usage

```bash
python DRfold_infer.py test/seq.fasta test/8fza_A/ 1
```

The final results can be found in `test/8fza_A/relax/`.

**Note:** For long RNA sequences, you may want to clear intermediate results from `test/8fza_A/` to save space.

## Performance

DRfold2 has been extensively tested on non-redundant test sets with various redundancy cut-offs, consistently demonstrating superior performance in:
- 3D structure prediction
- 2D base pair modeling
- Co-evolutionary feature learning from unsupervised data
